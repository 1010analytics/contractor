### Contractor Repository Description

This repository is designed for managing contractor-related projects. It includes two main components: a client-side application and a server-side application. The client folder contains the frontend code, while the server folder houses the backend code. Both sections are built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The repository is intended for developers looking to set up a project involving client-server interactions. Contributions and improvements to the repository are encouraged.
