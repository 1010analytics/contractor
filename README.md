### Contractor Repository Description

1)This website is build to  interview contractors  and then add them to the system as “verified Contractors” and create their services categories and services for them. After that they can log in and set their own schedule and update their calendars

2)Homeowners will be able to brows available services and book their appointment.
Looking to split the work in phases and hoping to start with phase one which will be easy and requires only few hours just to test working together before we commit and move on with the project.
